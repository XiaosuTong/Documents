For the question 4c,
the execution time for MergeSort is :
	real	0m4.598s
	user	0m0.632s
	sys  	0m0.264s
the execution time for 100 times of QuickSort is :
	real	9m53.975s
	user	0m52.203s
	sys	    0m26.018s
So the average performance of QuickSort is a little better than MergeSort.


For the question 5,
the output for the R code would be :
1 4 9 16 25
Because after we print the value of x, the value of x will be re-defined between 1 to 5.
the output for the C code would be:
1 4 16 
Because after we print the value of x, the value of x will be keeped into the decision statement in for statment.
