tasks
-Classification
  learning alg
  decide feature representation
    the classificaion function domain
    captures properties of the input object
  model/representation
    classifier = function
    boolean functions, linear functions(hyperplanes)
  optimization/learning algorithm
-Regression
  similar to classification except real values labels
-Clustering
  belongs unsupervised learning
-Structured Prediction
  mapping between complex objects
  face detector: combines eyes, nose and mouth detectors
  define constraints, make decision jointly
-Reinforcement learning
  most natural machine learning setting
  goal: take a sequence of actions to maximize rewards
