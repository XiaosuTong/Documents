##Update your fork directly from GitHub
1.Open your fork on GitHub.
2.Click on Pull Requests.
3.Click on New Pull Request. By default, GitHub will compare the original 
with your fork, and there shouldn’t be anything to compare if you didn’t 
make any changes.
4.Click on switching the base (if no changes were made in the fork) or 
click Edit and switch the base manually. Now GitHub will compare your fork 
with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
5.Click on Create to create a pull request for this comparison and assign 
a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., Update from original).
6.Click on Send pull request. Scroll down and click Merge pull request and 
finally Confirm merge. If your fork didn’t have any changes, you will be able 
to merge it automatically.
