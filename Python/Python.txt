#1.Hashing is the process of converting some large amount of data into a much smaller amount (typically
a single integer) in a repeatable way so that it can be looked up in a table in constant-time (O(1)), 
which is important for high-performance algorithms and data structures.
Immutability is the idea that an object will not change in some important way after it has been 
created, especially in any way that might change the hash value of that object.
The two ideas are related because objects which are used as hash keys must typically be immutable so 
their hash value doesn't change. If it was allowed to change then the location of that object in a 
data structure such as a hashtable would change and then the whole purpose of hashing for efficiency 
is defeated.

#2. double ** usage
There are two different situations that will relate to **.
First one happens when we are trying to define a function:
----
def fun(**keyarg):
    for a in kwargs:
		print a, kwargs[a]

output looks like this:
fun(name="one", age=27)
age 27
name one
----
Another one happens when we are calling the function:
----
def fun(name, age):
	print(name, age)

output looks like this:
fun(**{'name':1, 'age':2})
1 2
----
