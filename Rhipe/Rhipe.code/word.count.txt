Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday proposed a smaller budget than projected earlier this year and 
repeatedly cautioned against new spending, disappointing Democratic lawmakers who had hoped that 
rising state tax revenues would finance social programs after years of austerity.
California has benefited from an unexpected billion windfall in personal income tax receipts this year.
But Mr. Brown, in announcing his revised budget in Sacramento, said that the federal government's elimination
of a two percent payroll tax reduction and the spending cuts caused by the federal sequestration would 
lead to only a billion surplus in the current fiscal year. IN the next fiscal year, starting in July, the
governor said, the state will collect billion less than expected. The revised budget of billion for the
next fiscal year, a billion reduction in spending, compared with the billion plan announced in January,
includes increased spending for eduction.
